About Me

Hi, my name is Andrei Badescu and I am a Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences at University of Toronto. I was born in Bucharest, Romania, where I have studied Mathematics and Economics at [Bucharest University of Economic Studies](https://www.ase.ro/index_en.asp) (BSc ’98, MSc ’00). I moved to Canada in 2000 and I have obtained my PhD ’04 in Actuarial Science  at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/), under the supervision of  David Stanford. Following my PhD, I have completed a two year postdoctoral fellowship ’06 at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), under the supervision of [Gord Willmot]( https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/gord-willmot).  In 2006 I have joined the [Department of Statistical Sciences]( https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto]( https://www.utoronto.ca/), as an Assistant Professor. I was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011 and to Full Professor in 2020. Over the years I have been in many administrative positions among whom I was the Director of the [Master of Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/), the Data Science concentration '21. Currently, I am the Director of the [Master of Financial Insurance](https://mfi.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto.

Research Interests 
======
In my earlier academic career I was mainly interested in Mathematical Risk Theory and its connections to Queuing Theory and Stochastic Fluid Flows, by implying Matrix Analytic Methods to tackle such problems. Later on, I have expanded my research interests in the areas of Stochastic Claim Reserving, Operational Risk, Modelling Dependence in Actuarial Science, Ratemaking, Predictive Analytics in Insurance. Future directions where I would like to expand my research areas are Telematics and Insurance Data Science.  I have been published papers in some of the most important journals in Actuarial Science and related areas such as, [Insurance: Mathematics and Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/insurance-mathematics-and-economics), [Astin Bulletin](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/astin-bulletin-journal-of-the-iaa), [Scandinavian Actuarial Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/sact20/current), [North American Actuarial Journal]( https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uaaj20/current), [Journal of Applied Probability]( https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-applied-probability), [Queuing Systems]( https://www.springer.com/journal/11134). Currently I am Associate Editor of the [Insurance: Mathematics and Economics]( https://www.journals.elsevier.com/insurance-mathematics-and-economics).
